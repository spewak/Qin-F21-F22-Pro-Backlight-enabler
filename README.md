# Description
This simple Magisk module for the Qin F21 Pro always enables the keyboard backlight when the screen is on.  
v1.1
Added support for F22pro.  
You need to set backlit timeout to 5s. Backlit may enable/disable with small delay. This is rather workaround than fix. 

# Requirements
- Qin F21 Pro/ Qin F22 Pro
- Magisk v21+

# Installation and removal
Install/Remove via the Magisk Manager Modules tab
